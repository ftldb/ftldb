FTLDB
=====

<img src="https://raw.github.com/ftldb/ftldb/master/logo.png" align="right" width="300px" />

An integration of [FreeMarker](http://freemarker.org) Java template engine into **Oracle Database** for an easier server-side code generation.

Allows you to create, store, and execute templates written in FTL inside a database. You can generate any kind of SQL/DML/DDL statements or stored program units using metadata retrieved from queries and calls. Instead of composing complex string expressions full of quotes and concatenation operators (as you may currently do) just write plain SQL or PL/SQL code spiced with FTL macros in you favorite IDE with the full support of its code completion and syntax highlighting features.
